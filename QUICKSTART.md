- You'll see: `[INFO] Daily direction determined: CE`

**10:00 AM** - Entry window opens
- Bot can now place trades
- Waits for hourly alignment

**10:15 AM** - First hourly analysis
- Checks if hourly aligns with daily
- Evaluates entry filters (RSI, EMA, VIX)
- If all pass ‚Üí Places order

**During Market Hours**
- Monitors open positions
- Updates stop loss / trailing stop

- Tracks daily P&L

**3:20 PM** - End of day
- Closes all open positions
- Saves trade history
- Resets counters

**3:30 PM** - Market close

## First Trade Walkthrough

When bot places your first trade, you'll see:

```
[INFO] Daily direction determined: CE (ADX: 28.5)
[INFO] Hourly alignment confirmed (ADX: 24.2)
[INFO] Entry signal generated: CE @ strike 19500
[INFO] Order placed successfully: order_uuid
[INFO] Order executed @ 125.50
[INFO] Position opened: NIFTY24OCT19500CE x 50 @ 125.50
[INFO] Position updated: Current price: 128.30, PNL: +140.00 (+2.2%)
[INFO] Trailing stop activated @ 126.37
[INFO] Trailing stop updated @ 129.15
[INFO] Position closed: Exit @ 145.20, PNL: +985.00 (+15.7%) - TRAILING_STOP
```

## Monitoring

### Console
- Real-time logs appear in terminal
- Shows all important events
- Press Ctrl+C for graceful shutdown

### Event Log
- Check `data/events.jsonl` for full audit trail
- One event per line (JSON format)
- Useful for debugging

### Trade History
- Check `data/trades_YYYYMMDD.json` at end of day
- Contains all completed trades
- Includes entry/exit prices, P&L, reasons

## Stopping the Bot

Press **Ctrl+C** to stop:

```
[INFO] Ctrl+C received - initiating graceful shutdown
[WARN] Closing 1 open positions
[INFO] Position closed: Exit @ 132.40, Reason: Shutdown
[INFO] Completed 3 trades today
[INFO] Shutdown sequence completed in 2s
```

Bot will:
1. Close all open positions
2. Save trade history
3. Log final events
4. Exit cleanly

## Verification Checklist

Before live trading, verify:

- [ ] Bot starts without errors
- [ ] Authentication successful (check logs)
- [ ] Market hours detected correctly
- [ ] Daily direction analysis runs (9:30 AM)
- [ ] Hourly analysis runs every hour
- [ ] Stop loss works (test in paper mode)
- [ ] VIX circuit breaker activates (simulate)
- [ ] EOD exit happens at 3:20 PM
- [ ] Ctrl+C shutdown works cleanly

## Common Issues

### "Authentication failed"
- **Fix**: Check TOTP secret is base32 format
- **Verify**: Use TOTP app to confirm 6-digit codes match

### "Market closed"
- **Fix**: Normal behavior outside 9:15 AM - 3:30 PM IST
- **Action**: Bot will auto-start when market opens

### "No trades happening"
- **Reason 1**: Daily ADX below threshold (weak trend)
- **Reason 2**: Hourly not aligned with daily
- **Reason 3**: VIX too high
- **Action**: Check `data/events.jsonl` for `DAILY_DIRECTION_DETERMINED` event

### "Permission denied" on data/
- **Fix**: Create data directory: `mkdir -p data`
- **Fix**: Check write permissions: `chmod 755 data`

## Next Steps

### 1. Run in Paper Mode (Recommended)
Edit `config.toml`:
```toml
enable_paper_trading = true
```
Run for 1-2 weeks to verify strategy.

### 2. Adjust Risk Settings
Start conservative:
```toml
max_positions = 1                    # One position at a time
daily_loss_limit_pct = 1.5          # Stricter limit
base_position_size_pct = 5.0        # Smaller size
```

### 3. Monitor Daily
- Check trade history each evening
- Review event logs for errors
- Track win rate and average P&L
- Adjust configuration as needed

### 4. Scale Gradually
- Week 1: 1 lot, 1 position
- Week 2-4: 2 lots, 2 positions
- Month 2+: Scale to comfort level
