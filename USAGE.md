# Usage Guide

## First Time Setup

### 1. Install Prerequisites

- Install Rust: https://rustup.rs
- Create Angel One account
- Enable API access in Angel One

### 2. Get Angel One Credentials

#### Client Code & Password
- Your Angel One login credentials

#### TOTP Secret
1. Open Angel One mobile app
2. Go to Settings â†’ API
3. Enable TOTP
4. Copy the **base32 secret** (not the 6-digit code)
   - Should look like: `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`

### 3. Configure

Edit `config.toml`:

```toml
angel_one_client_code = "A12345"
angel_one_password = "YourPassword"
angel_one_totp_secret = "JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP"
```

### 4. Build & Run

```bash
# Build (first time only)
cargo build --release

# Run
cargo run --release
```

## Understanding the Bot

### Strategy Overview

The bot uses a **Multi-Timeframe ADX Strategy**:

1. **Daily Analysis (9:30 AM)**
   - Calculates Daily ADX, +DI, -DI
   - Determines direction: CE (Call), PE (Put), or NO_TRADE
   - Only trades if ADX > threshold (strong trend)

2. **Hourly Analysis (Every hour)**
   - Calculates Hourly ADX, +DI, -DI
   - Checks alignment with daily direction
   - Waits for hourly confirmation

3. **Entry Filters (10:00 AM - 3:00 PM)**
   - RSI not overbought/oversold
   - Price above/below EMA
   - VIX below threshold
   - Risk checks passed

4. **Position Management**
   - 20% stop loss on option premium
   - Trailing stop activates at 2% profit
   - Trails 1.5% below highs
   - Auto-exits at 3:20 PM

```

## Risk Management

### VIX Circuit Breaker

**Scenario 1: VIX Spike During Trading**
```
VIX crosses 30 â†’ Circuit breaker ACTIVE
    â†“
All open positions closed immediately
    â†“
No new entries until VIX < 22
```

**Scenario 2: High VIX at Market Open**
```
Market opens, VIX = 32
    â†“
Bot in NO_TRADE mode
    â†“
Monitors VIX throughout the day
    â†“
When VIX < 22, resumes normal operation
```

### Daily Loss Limit

```
Daily P&L reaches -2% of capital
    â†“
All positions closed
    â†“
Bot stops taking new trades
    â†“
Resets next day
```

### Position Limits

- **Max positions**: 3 concurrent
- **Max quantity**: Respects freeze quantity
- **Consecutive losses**: Stops after 3 losses

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Clean Entry & Target Hit

```
09:30 â†’ Daily: CE direction (ADX=28)
10:15 â†’ Hourly: Aligned (ADX=24)
10:15 â†’ Entry signal generated
10:15 â†’ Order placed: NIFTY 19500 CE @ 125
10:16 â†’ Order filled
10:45 â†’ Trailing stop activated (PNL = 2.1%)
11:30 â†’ Target hit â†’ Position closed
Result: +8.5% profit
```

### Scenario 2: Stop Loss Hit

```
09:30 â†’ Daily: PE direction
10:15 â†’ Entry: NIFTY 19500 PE @ 110
10:30 â†’ Price moves against us
10:45 â†’ Stop loss triggered @ 88 (-20%)
Result: -20% loss (as expected)
```

### Scenario 3: VIX Spike

```
10:15 â†’ Position opened
11:30 â†’ VIX spikes to 32
11:30 â†’ Circuit breaker activated
11:30 â†’ Position closed immediately @ market price
11:45 â†’ VIX = 31 (still high)
12:30 â†’ VIX drops to 21
12:30 â†’ Circuit breaker deactivated
12:45 â†’ Bot resumes trading (if other conditions met)
```

### Scenario 4: Daily Loss Limit

```
Trade 1: -1.2% loss
Trade 2: -0.9% loss
Total: -2.1% (exceeds -2% limit)
    â†“
All positions closed
No new trades for rest of day
```

### Scenario 5: Alignment Lost

```
10:15 â†’ Entry: CE position opened
12:15 â†’ Hourly bar: Alignment lost (ADX weak)
12:15 â†’ Exit signal generated
12:15 â†’ Position closed
Reason: "ALIGNMENT_LOST"
```

## Configuration Tuning

### Conservative Settings

For lower risk:

```toml
option_stop_loss_pct = 0.15          # Tighter stop
trail_activate_pnl_pct = 0.015       # Activate earlier
max_positions = 2                    # Fewer positions
daily_loss_limit_pct = 1.5           # Stricter limit
vix_threshold = 22.0                 # Lower VIX threshold
daily_adx_threshold = 28.0           # Higher ADX (stronger trends)
```

### Aggressive Settings

For higher risk/reward:

```toml
option_stop_loss_pct = 0.25          # Wider stop
trail_activate_pnl_pct = 0.03        # Activate later
max_positions = 5                    # More positions
daily_loss_limit_pct = 3.0           # Higher limit
vix_threshold = 28.0                 # Higher VIX tolerance
daily_adx_threshold = 22.0           # Lower ADX (more trades)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Won't Start

**Error: "Authentication failed"**
- Check client code/password
- Verify TOTP secret is base32 (not the 6-digit code)
- Ensure system time is correct

**Error: "Token expired"**
- Bot will auto-refresh
- If fails, delete `data/tokens.json` and restart

**Error: "Market closed"**
- Normal behavior outside market hours
- Bot will wait for market open

### No Trades Happening

**1. Check Daily Direction**
- Look for `DAILY_DIRECTION_DETERMINED` event
- If `NO_TRADE`, daily ADX is too low (weak trend)

**2. Check Hourly Alignment**
- Look for `HOURLY_ALIGNMENT_CONFIRMED` event
- If missing, hourly and daily not aligned

**3. Check Entry Filters**
- Look for `ENTRY_FILTERS_EVALUATED` event
- See which filter failed (RSI, EMA, VIX, etc.)

**4. Check Risk Limits**
- VIX too high?
- Already hit daily loss limit?
- Max positions reached?

### Unexpected Exits

**Check exit reason in `data/trades_YYYYMMDD.json`:**

- `STOP_LOSS`: Hit 20% stop
- `TRAILING_STOP`: Trailed back from profit
- `TARGET`: Hit profit target
- `VIX_SPIKE`: Circuit breaker
- `DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT`: Risk limit
- `ALIGNMENT_LOST`: Strategy invalidated
- `EOD_MANDATORY_EXIT`: End of day

## Safety Features

### Graceful Shutdown (Ctrl+C)

```
User presses Ctrl+C
    â†“
Bot receives signal
    â†“
Closes all open positions
    â†“
Saves trade history
    â†“
Logs final events
    â†“
Exits cleanly
```

### Crash Recovery

If bot crashes unexpectedly:

1. All events are already logged (durable)
2. Restart bot
3. Bot will reconcile positions with broker
4. Resume normal operation

### Data Integrity

- **Atomic writes**: No partial data
- **Idempotency**: No duplicate trades
- **Event sourcing**: Full audit trail
- **Crash-safe**: Immediate disk sync

## Best Practices

### 1. Paper Trading First

- Set `enable_paper_trading = true` in config
- Run for 1-2 weeks
- Verify strategy performance
- Check all exit scenarios

### 2. Start Small

- Use 1-2 lots initially
- Gradually increase size
- Monitor P&L closely
- Adjust risk parameters

### 3. Monitor Regularly

- Check console output
- Review `data/events.jsonl` daily
- Analyze `data/trades_*.json`
- Track win rate, average P&L

### 4. Update Configuration

- Adjust based on market conditions
- Lower ADX threshold in ranging markets
- Tighten VIX limits during volatility
- Review settings weekly

### 5. Backup Data

```bash
# Daily backup
tar -czf backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz data/
```
